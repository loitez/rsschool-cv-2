        <h2 class="job-title">Junior Frontend Developer</h2>
        <p class="about-me">I am 19 years old, study at pretty good university and work as a photographer. I am really keen on taking photos, especially, during the gigs. If you are interested, you can see them on my website. Some people describe me as a person who managed to combine the incongruous: Frontend Developement, Hindi and work with stroke patients. I’m currently working on making a Hindi adaptation of one test which allows to estimate certain types of memory. In the near future all medical community will be able to use it. As for Frontend Development, I became interested in it while creating my website on CMS. I have been acquiring new skills, step by step, with ups and downs, for almost one year. I am really passionate about it and strongly believe that I will achieve everything I want since desire is one of the strongest motivators.</p>
